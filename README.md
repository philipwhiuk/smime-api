# About

This repository contains the API linking OpenSMIME (and potientially other S/MIME libraries) with K-9 
(and potientially other email clients).

It provides a common interface for decrypting emails and linking certificates to users.

It was forked from the original student project which provided the base for OpenSMIME and this API.

# Plan

The plan is to develop a common interface in co-ordination with the developers of K-9 
and submit it to http://www.openintents.org/

Other email applications can also register interest should they wish to use the API.

# Issues

Please raise issues against this repository, not the parent.
